        <span id="buttext">Third Object: Across your paintings, you use many different
kinds of mark making techniques, and this leads to a broad
variation in the images you produce. How do you determine
what vocabulary to use in each canvas?</span>
<br><br>
Hannah Tarr: Well, I like to surprise myself. I never plan a painting
completely. I’ll have a vague idea of what I want to make, then I
go for it. The weirder the better, whether it be weird due to color
choice, mark making or texture. I know I can’t make anything “new,”
but if I can make myself laugh by using nail polish on a painting,
then I’ve succeeded.
              <br><br><br>
              <span id="buttext">How does Untitled (Butt) fit within your larger practice?</span>
              <br><br>
I made the Butt for a show here in Chicago with Kate Ruggeri at
Roots & Culture. The show featured a series of abstracted portraits.
Like I said earlier, I like to surprise myself. In one of the paintings
(the largest in the show, which ended up being a sort of portrait
of my cat) I used a magazine clipping of a face for the nose. This
was the only collaged element in the whole show; it was awkward
and, to me, hilarious. The Butt had this same function in the show
as a whole: one surprising gesture, a Butt in a series of faces. The
portraits are more labored, have more sophisticated line work (or at
least I’d like to think so), but the Butt is cartoony, crudely rendered,
monochrome. I like to think of it as punctuation mark.
Your most recent body of work (shown at Roots & Culture,
Chicago, Fall 2014) included several portrait paintings. 
              <br><br><br>            
<span id="buttext">We’re curious about the role of specificity in your work, which is to
say, are these portraits of existing people? Is Untitled (Butt) a
    portrait?</span>
              <br><br>
In my previous work, I focused on iterations of landscape. Portraits
were a natural progression for me. Landscapes and portraits are
both iconic, historical genres of painting. I said earlier that I don’t
expect to make anything “new,” so why not go old school and paint
only landscapes and portraits? My portraits are not of existing
people. I think most of them are paintings of existing portraits:
the sad clown, the Van Gogh self-portrait. They exist as ideas of
portraiture, rather than trying to depict an actual person.<br><br>
              
And yes, the Butt is a sort of portrait. As a woman, I think about
how weird it is to be identified by a certain body part. Ass, breasts,
whatever. It’s weird. For instance, I have a friend with an amazingly,
abnormally, huge ass and she can neither hide nor stop hearing
about it — from strangers, friends, randy co-workers, new and
inebriated acquaintances. It’s not just bizarre, it makes me frustrated
and angry in a way I don’t know how to express or deal with. We
cannot help our bodies. We should not have to apologize for our
bodies. We should not have to walk around feeling eyes, feeling like
meat (to be devoured) or lethal weapons (damn girl, you’re killin it).
Now don’t get me wrong, I love butts; however, I wanted to paint a
weird, desexualized butt experience, kind of exposing the silliness of
it all. I painted a shape, a cartoon.

<span id="buttext">Untitled (Butt) overtly creates a voyeuristic experience, but
its cartoony rendering shifts the fantasy into a humorous
experience. Would you say a bit about voyeurism (and humor)
as it relates to Untitled (Butt) and your work in general? Is this
    something you’re interested in exploring more in your work?</span>
        <br><br>
Voyeurism implies a sort of secret intimacy. I guess the subject, the
Butt, is inherently intimate, but I don’t quite consider the painting
itself a voyeuristic experience. And butts are everywhere: in movies,
tv, pornography. We’re used to seeing them. So I’m not even sure
that seeing a butt implies intimacy. I wanted to touch on this with
the paint handling, the cartoon-like rendering. It’s a crudely executed
butt icon.<br><br>
                
Most Americans partake in voyeuristic experiences in the form of
pornography. In most porn there is already a sort of cartooning
going on in service of fantasy. There’s even outright cartoon porn,
or Japanese Hentai porn (tons of big, shiny boobs and butts), but
the live action stuff is just as fake to me. I don’t know if I find this
humorous or not. I’m interested in voyeurism, but not sure how it will
make its way into my practice again.
        <br><br><br>
<span id="buttext">How do the sculptural objects that you make relate to your
    paintings -- do they inform one another?</span>
                <br><br>
Absolutely. A painting is an object we’re all familiar with. We
all know a painting when we see one, and mine are all very
traditionally shaped (squares and rectangles) which gives them away
immediately. I like having my weird, lumpy, little painted sculptures
next to my paintings. Hopefully they throw people off a little.

<span id="buttext">What’s your favorite name for the gluteus maximus?</span>
                <br><br>
While I do like “tush,” I’m more of an ass girl.
